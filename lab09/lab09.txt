What good has this bundling done? How big is the new bundle file? Check the Chrome DevTools network log to see what files are being loaded.

The bundle reduces the number of requests and amount of data sent to the server, which decreases the size of the application. The total data for lab09 is 14kb, at 28 ssecs , and 21 kb at 28 sec for lab08.
	
What role did Babel play in the bundling?

Babel transposes code from newer versions into older versions that build faster and are more often supported by browsers.

Can you just load file:///path…/index.html using the browser? Why or why not?

The header COMMENTS and the form appear, but when data is entered nothing happens. This is because it is a static webpage operationg without a server.

In webpack.config.js, what does the loader test entry test: /\.jsx?$/ do?

This loads the babel config file (.babelrc) and excludes node_modules.

Check out the new dist/index.html and dist/bundle.js. How are they different from the previous versions?

The new index.html and bundle.js are in es2015, which is an older and more supported via better optimization in broswers. The code we wrote last week, was in a newer (then es2015) code, but is less supported, but shorter. 

What good is it to replace the CDN library loads with module imports?
It will allow the code to load faster, because it knows exactly what libraries/imports  it needs to use and which it doesnt need.

Check the network log. How many of the new modules you built are being loaded? How about the CSS file?
Only 1. Bundle.js , the css file is being loaded as well. 


Try out both ports and explain the difference between them.
    localhost:3001 — Try editing one of the React module files. Explain what happens, both to the displayed SPA webpage and to the bundle/index files.
    	-  That's cool!...When you make a change to the comment.js file (react module), and save it on sublime, it automatically refreshes the webpage and  clears the network HTTP method history.

    localhost:3000 — Try loading /api/comments. Explain what you get. Does the SPA page running on this port change (due to the edits made above) as well?
    	- I get a list of all the comments formatted in a JSON. No this page does not change when the edit is made to the SPA.



Is it worth all this trouble to build a development configuration?
It depends, if you are going to have a static webpage, where little will change, and (like a wikipedia article)
Then to build a page like this is pointless. But since most pages nowadays, are not static, it is worth the effort
of trying to make the page a SPA, and optimize it by using Babel w/ webpack to bundle files and optimize them for the 
modern day interent. This is becuase nowadays, most pages are interactive, and have data being sent back and forth between
server and client, so it is more efficent to use a older form of JS that is more compatiable with broswer/ more optimized 
with broswers.
